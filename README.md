# <img src="./logo/sch_tf.svg" width=35> SCH
a privacy-focused messaging application designed to provide users with a secure and confidential communication platform. It aims to protect user privacy by prioritizing data security, avoiding the use of cookies and trackers, and providing a trustworthy environment for exchanging messages.

## Key Features

- **Data Security**: SCH ensures secure transmission of your messages and prioritizes user privacy. Messages are not stored on the server and are directly sent to the intended recipients. The server only acts as a conduit, and copies of messages are only present on the users' screens, providing an extra layer of privacy and confidentiality.

- **Cookie and Tracker-Free**: Unlike many messaging apps, SCH does not rely on cookies or trackers to gather user data. We believe in preserving your online privacy and keeping your personal information secure.

- **Trustworthy Environment**: SCH provides a trustworthy environment for exchanging messages. It aims to foster open and secure communication between users, without compromising on data privacy or exposing you to unnecessary risks.
